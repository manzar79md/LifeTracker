# LifeTracker 🧭

LifeTracker is a simple Flask-based web application designed to help people who feel confused, pressured, or lost in their career or life direction.

It does not judge.  
It does not promise miracles.  
It simply helps you understand **where you are right now** and **what to do next**.
